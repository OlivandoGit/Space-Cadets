My code for the Space Cadets Challenges

**Challenge 1 Notes:**

Write a Web service to Fetch an email ID and get a lecturers's name (from [https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/])


**Challenge 2 Notes:**

Build a bare bones interpreter to take text file and produce an output

Additional notes:
 - BareBones Source code must be in file named [Sourcecode.txt](https://github.com/OlivandoGit/Space-Cadets/blob/master/Challenge2/Sourcecode.txt) and be in the same directory as interpreter.
 - BareBones interpreter does not yet include any syntax or error checking.
